And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful , he said , How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God !
But they said , Not on the feast day , lest there be an uproar of the people .
To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh , that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus .
